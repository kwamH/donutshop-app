<h1>Donut Shop Register and Management System Console Application</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
 <b>The app is a cash register and menu management system for a donut shop.  When started, the program prompts the user to enter an employee login ID.  If the regular employee ID is entered, the program takes you to the menu.  It then lets the user select what he wants and prints out a ticket as a text file with the items he ordered, the price of each, subtotal, total, and ticket number that will be called when his order is ready.  The ticket number is randomly generated every new transaction.  If admin ID is entered, it allows the user to edit the prices of any item and delete any items to simulate if it was out of stock.  If admin functions are no longer needed, the user can navigate back to the login screen and enter the employee ID and the program will act as the cash register again.</b>
